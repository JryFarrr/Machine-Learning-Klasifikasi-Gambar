# Machine-Learning-Klasifikasi-Gambar
# I created a machine learning project to calorize images from 3 labels: rock, paper, scissors. I used a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model with data train and validation data sharing of 80 percent and 20 percent respectively. I also supplemented this program with a callback function. As a result, I obtained a satisfactory accuracy of 95 percent. Hopefully with this project I can collaborate and this project can be useful to others. Happy contact me all :D
